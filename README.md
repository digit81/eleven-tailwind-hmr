# Eleven Tailwind Hmr

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.2.

This illustrates how the new --hmr flag can be used in an Angular CLI app with TailwindCSS. It is made possible thanks to [@ngneat/tailwind](https://github.com/ngneat/tailwind) and [@angular-builders/custom-webpack@11.0.0-beta.1](https://github.com/just-jeb/angular-builders/tree/master/packages/custom-webpack)
